# Hue

Hue is a next-generation password manager with innovative features designed to enhance user experience and security. It is divided into three main sections as outlined below.

## Account Creation

Account creation is further broken down into two distinct categories:

### First-party Account Creation

First-party account creation leverages intents, which are specific actions or requirements set by the website or app developers. Intents may be either optional or mandatory.

Mandatory intents are required during the account creation process, while optional ones can be enabled or disabled by the user. 

Intents vary in scope. Some are fully managed by Hue, such as an "18+" confirmation, which only sends a "true" or "false" response to the service. Enhanced intents, like "18+ (ID verified)," offer additional verification without revealing personal information. Hue handles all processes in the background, ensuring your private data remains protected unless explicitly required by the service.

### Third-party Account Creation

For third-party services, Hue generates a unique custom email address for each account, such as "grphlVdSoQT7ulOWgYCtAf12aXXLia@hueprivacy.com." This process also auto-fills any required information based on user-defined placeholders, while disabling marketing or promotional emails by default.

Hue manages all passwords and automatically enables two-factor authentication (2FA), where supported. Email verification processes are also handled automatically. (Note: The account creation process occurs client-side for enhanced privacy and security.)

## Account Sign-in

Hue automates the account sign-in process. This can be initiated through a pop-up requesting user confirmation or performed automatically when the user visits a supported website.

## Dashboard

Unlike traditional password managers that require manual updates to each service, Hue provides a centralized dashboard where you can manage all accounts seamlessly.

Through this intuitive interface, Hue offers additional features like account deletion or data requests in compliance with GDPR regulations. It also keeps you informed of important updates, such as changes to a service's Terms of Service, providing a comprehensive overview in one convenient place.
